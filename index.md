I’m the Director of Docs Strategy & Platform at GitHub, leading content design, content strategy, product management, and open source for [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com). 🌟 We use a unique content design process to build customer needs into planning, creating, and evaluating documentation.

I’m passionate about connecting people with whatever they need to accomplish their goals. At GitHub, I’ve also been a content strategist, a technical writer, and a supportocat. I’ve lived in Canada, Germany, and all over the US working as a librarian, a community organizer in public schools, an English teacher, and a wine specialist. 

If you want to chat docs, I'd love to hear from you!
